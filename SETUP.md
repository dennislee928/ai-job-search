# Setup Guide

Step-by-step instructions for getting the AI Job Search framework running.

## 1. Prerequisites

- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)**: Must be installed and running.
- **Docker Compose**: Included with Docker Desktop.
- **Python 3.11+**: For running the Robot Framework test suite.

## 2. Boot the Infrastructure

This platform is a polyglot microservice architecture. To start everything, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

This will spin up the following containers:
- `api-gateway` (Go)
- `ai-service` (Python/FastAPI)
- `data-service` (Julia)
- `frontend` (Next.js)
- `postgres` (Relational Database)
- `minio` (S3 Object Storage)
- `qdrant` (Vector Database)
- `neo4j` (Graph Database)
- `redis` (Cache)

Wait for the containers to fully initialize before proceeding.

## 3. Verify End-to-End Tests

We use Robot Framework to ensure the microservices communicate with the databases correctly.

```bash
cd tests/robot
pip install -r requirements.txt
robot api_tests.robot
```

The tests will verify:
- API Gateway writes users to PostgreSQL.
- AI Service uploads resumes to MinIO.
- AI Service queries Qdrant for Semantic Matches.
- Data Service queries Neo4j for Graph Traversals.

## 4. Run the Web UI

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with the fully refactored AI Job Search assistant from the web interface!

## 4. Run the setup interview

Start Claude Code in the repository:

```bash
claude
```

Then run the onboarding:

```
/setup
```

Claude will offer three paths:

- **Path A (documents folder):** Add your CV, LinkedIn export, diplomas, references, or past applications under `documents/`. Claude reads and cross-references them before proposing profile updates. This is best when you have several source files.
- **Path B (single CV import):** Share one CV/resume by mentioning the file with `@` or pasting the text. Claude extracts it and asks follow-up questions for anything missing.
- **Path C (interview mode):** Answer structured interview questions section by section.

All three paths produce the same result: fully populated profile files.

### What gets populated

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Your full candidate profile |
| `01-candidate-profile.md` | Structured education, experience, skills |
| `02-behavioral-profile.md` | Behavioral assessment |
| `04-job-evaluation.md` | Personalized skill match areas and career goals |
| `05-cv-templates.md` | Profile statement templates for your background |
| `07-interview-prep.md` | STAR examples from your experience |
| `cv/main_example.tex` | Your LaTeX CV with actual details |
| `search-queries.md` | Job search queries for `/scrape` |

### Re-running setup

You can update specific sections later:

```
/setup --section skills
/setup --section experience
/setup --section search
```

The `--section search` option is especially useful as your priorities evolve. It re-runs the search configuration interview and suggests role types you may not have considered based on your full profile.

## 5. Optional: Set up salary benchmarking

If you have salary data (from a union, salary survey, Glassdoor, or personal research):

1. **Option A:** Create `salary_data.json` manually in the repo root (see `tools/README_SALARY_TOOL.md` for the format)
2. **Option B:** Convert from Excel:
   ```bash
   pip install openpyxl
   python3 tools/convert_salary_excel.py path/to/salary-data.xlsx --source "My Salary Data 2025"
   ```

This creates `salary_data.json` which the `/apply` workflow uses for salary benchmarking. If you skip this step, salary lookup is simply omitted.

## 6. Test the workflow

Find a job posting you're interested in, then:

```
/apply https://jobindex.dk/job/1234567
```

Or paste the job description directly:

```
/apply [paste job posting text here]
```

Claude will:
1. Evaluate the fit against your profile
2. Ask if you want to proceed
3. Draft a tailored CV and cover letter
4. Have a reviewer agent critique the drafts
5. Revise and present the final output

## 7. Compile your documents

After `/apply` creates the LaTeX files:

```bash
# Bash / zsh / Git Bash
cd cv && lualatex main_<company>_<role>.tex && cd ..
cd cover_letters && xelatex cover_<company>_<role>.tex && cd ..
```

```powershell
# PowerShell
Set-Location cv; lualatex main_<company>_<role>.tex; Set-Location ..
Set-Location cover_letters; xelatex cover_<company>_<role>.tex; Set-Location ..
```

These commands apply to the stock templates (moderncv CV, `cover.cls` cover letter). If you'd rather use your own LaTeX template, run `/add-template` — it captures the template's compile engine, fonts, style rules, and page limit, test-compiles it, and wires it into `/apply`. See the "LaTeX templates" section in the README.

## 8. Pulling upstream updates into your fork

Upstream keeps improving the methodology files your fork has personalized, so plan for updates from day one:

1. **Commit your personalization to your fork.** `/setup` edits CLAUDE.md and the profile skill files in place — those edits are *yours*, and your fork is private working space, so commit them. The genuinely sensitive files (tracker, salary data, `documents/`, application archives) are gitignored and never enter git either way. An uncommitted working tree is the most common reason `git pull` refuses to merge at all (`Your local changes ... would be overwritten`).
2. **Preview what changed before pulling:**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream    # or origin, if you cloned the template directly
   python3 tools/check_upstream_updates.py
   ```
   It compares the `framework_version` markers in your framework files against upstream and lists exactly which methodology files changed, with the diff command for each.
3. **Merge normally.** `git merge upstream/master` (or `git pull`) three-way-merges upstream's edits around your personalization; because methodology edits rarely touch the lines `/setup` filled in, most updates land cleanly. A conflict in a personalized file is a *feature*, not a failure — it means upstream changed methodology in a section you customized, and the version marker plus its changelog commit tell you why. Resolve by keeping your data and adopting the methodology change around it.

## Troubleshooting

### "salary_data.json not found"
This is expected if you haven't set up salary benchmarking. The `/apply` workflow skips this step automatically.

### Job search CLI tools not working
Make sure Bun is installed and you ran `bun install` in each CLI directory. The tools require network access to fetch job listings.

### LaTeX compilation errors
- CV: uses `lualatex` (pdflatex often fails on modern MiKTeX with `fontawesome5` font-expansion errors; lualatex handles the same sources cleanly)
- Cover letter: uses `xelatex` (for custom fonts in `OpenFonts/fonts/`)
- Make sure your LaTeX distribution includes the `moderncv` package

### Fonts not found in cover letter
The cover letter template expects fonts in `cover_letters/OpenFonts/fonts/`. Make sure this directory exists and contains the Lato and Raleway font files.

### Stale `.claude/settings.local.json` from an older clone
Shared Claude Code permissions now live in `.claude/settings.json` (scoped to `bun run`, `python salary_lookup.py`, and `python3 salary_lookup.py`). Earlier versions of this repo committed a broader `.claude/settings.local.json` that pre-approved `Bash(curl:*)`, `Bash(python:*)` and `Bash(bun:*)`. If you cloned before that change, git leaves the old file behind in your working copy, and its permissions still apply on top of `settings.json`. Delete it (or trim it to your own personal overrides):

```bash
rm .claude/settings.local.json
```
